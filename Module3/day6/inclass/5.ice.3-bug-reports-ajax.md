# 5.ICE.3: Bug Reports AJAX

Create an app that tracks bugs in a code base.

Begin by _**forking**_ cloning [the starter repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ajax-bugs-bootcamp) This is also the PCE for today.

### Database Schema

#### Bug Table \(`bugs`\)

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID | 1 |
| problem | TEXT | Description of the problem. | Crashes on POST request. |
| errorText | TEXT | Error output text, if any. | Cannot set property "fill" of null. |
| commit | TEXT | Associated Git commit, if any. | 961f1c |

## Base

Create a route for root `/`. The EJS file for this page will contain no elements. \(You will create them with JavaScript\).

When the page loads, create a button. The call to action is "Create a bug". When the user clicks the button, a form appears for them to fill out. \(Note, do not use a form element- remember that this is an element that creates a browser request by default. Just create a series of input elements\).

When the user clicks the submit button, the JavaScript takes the values and sends them in a POST request to the server. The server creates a bug in the database. When the response gets back to the browser, the form disappears from the page. A bug is added to the list of bugs.
