# Overview

## Overview

### Welcome to Software Engineering Bootcamp!

Software Engineering Bootcamp is Rocket Academy's flagship career conversion course. It builds on material taught in [Coding Basics](http://codingbasics.rocketacademy.co). On successful completion of Bootcamp, students can expect to be [job-ready full-stack software engineers](https://inewsnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5051722203\_890e2dab19\_b-811x900.jpg).



## Learning Objectives

What makes a good software engineer? Rocket aims to teach not just technical skills but mold students into well-rounded members of any high-level engineering team. This requires practicing many other things besides specific technical knowledge.

Our learning outcomes were informed by top-level industry standards for what an excellent engineer does, including rubrics implemented by companies like [Medium](https://medium.com): [https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-grading-rubric-8b409bec021f](https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-grading-rubric-8b409bec021f)

</details>

### Soft Technical

<details>

<summary><strong>Have a deeper understanding of the act of software development</strong></summary>

Expertise in specific technologies is only one aspect of being able to write high-quality software. Topics such as system design and architecture, basic CS knowledge and code fluency are extremely important for employers to distinguish between candidates.

</details>

### Soft Skills

<details>

<summary><strong>A strong software engineer is not just good with code, they are good with people.</strong></summary>

Good engineers can communicate their ideas clearly to a range of stakeholders- e.g, technical discussions with other developers, or non-technical discussions with designers, marketers or business people. They have empathy to work well with others. Understand that software specifications are written for humans and by humans.

* Pair Programming
* Code reading
* Code reviews
* Video demos
* Technical documentation
* Project Presentations
* Project / software development time estimation & time management
* Group work, project specifications & code collaboration
* Project completeness & polish
* Technical Interviews

</details>

### Curiosity and an eagerness to learn

<details>

<summary><strong>Cultivate the ability to solve new problems and formulate questions.</strong></summary>

It is normal not to understand things. A software engineer is not afraid to ask questions. We seek to develop an awareness of what you know and what you don’t know, so you can ask more intelligent questions to further your learning.

* Practice asking questions
* Practice formulating product specifications
* Pair Programming
* Practice designing applications at all levels of the process
* Understanding Project / Exercise Requirements
* Dealing with requirement ambiguity
* Practicing how to google / use the internet to gather information

</details>

## Principles

Below are the principles we adhere to in creating your educational experience.

<details>

<summary><strong>Spark curiosity, don’t provide a rabbit hole.</strong></summary>

In an effort to create T-Shaped individuals, our materials go 2 levels deep. It is then your curiosity that will take you deeper, especially in the projects.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Get it working first, then gain a deeper understanding.</strong></summary>

Projects and Exercises have base targets, then expand into comfortable / more comfortable levels.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Finding and fixing bugs is a skill to be shared.</strong></summary>

We use pair programming to help students develop communication skills, as well as develop the skill of reading other people’s code.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Understanding the WHY, helps you understand the WHAT and HOW.</strong></summary>

To create depth and a general awareness of the Web Development industry, the materials are arranged in a sort of chronological order of Web 1.0 to Web 2.0. The history of JS is particularly interesting, as it has been a work in progress for over 20 years.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Reading Code, Writing Code, Googling Code, and Modifying code are separate skills</strong></summary>

and are developed alongside one another.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Linear learning to build a foundation. Gestalt learning to expand.</strong></summary>

_**Linear learning**_ in the first half trains you in the key foundational areas layer by layer until you: Have a basic understanding of how software and the internet works reach a maturity that you can define and learn new things independently.

_**Gestalt thinking**_ refers to learning many small things and putting them together into a big idea/project. The second half trains you in selected technologies commonly used in the industry. These are disjoint tools that you can use as needed.

* We do linear learning in the first foundational part of the course, building up to a final web-application form.
* We do linear learning in non-project sections of the program by building prescribed applications with specific requirements.
* We do Gestalt thinking in the second part of the program by putting together the different parts of the system we’ve created.
* We do Gestalt thinking during projects by encouraging independent work as a summation of previous linear work.

## Course Syllabus

## Modules 1-3: Bootcamp Foundation&#x20;

The first 3 modules builds knowledge of web applications from the ground up, starting with running a simple one-line program and building up to a complex internet and data-backed application. Even though some of the content is not the latest industry-relevant technologies, these modules provide fundamental knowledge and practice in how the disparate parts of modern web applications are constructed, by constructing one yourself, piece-by-piece.

### Module 1: Basic Frontend&#x20;

This part of the program builds on the work done in Coding Basics. You will learn to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to construct static webpages (without a backend server) and deploy them on a hosting service. These topics comprise what we call Web 1.0.&#x20;

* Expand upon basics work to understand the wider context of JavaScript in the browser.
* Ramp up the complexity of programs we write.
* Introduce new levels of program abstraction, representation & complexity.
* Create mobile-responsive web layouts with CSS
* Hosting on Github pages and Heroku

### Module 2: Basic Backend

In this module you will learn to create a backend server, to not only host your website, but provide dynamically generated content, personalized based on user data stored in a database. This is effectively Web 1.5. &#x20;

* Introduce system-level runtime environment with Node.js
* Introduction to HTTP & Internet fundamentals
* Database & data storage fundamentals
* Web authentication
* Backend application fundamentals with NPM

### Module 3: Advanced Backend and Full Stack

In this module, you will learn to write a front end that interacts with the backend, removing the need to refresh the page on every click. This is effectively Web 2.0 and completes your Full Stack Development experience.

* Modern web-application architecture with Webpack
* Web 2.0 full-stack architecture
* MVC
* Managed cloud deployment with Heroku

## Modules 4-6: Latest Technologies

### Module 4: Frontend Framework - React

At this point, you are ready to explore modern development frameworks, that make rapid development possible. React is one of the most popular front end frameworks to learn.

* React.js front-end DOM libraries & architecture

### Module 5: Advanced React

Going deeper into React this module is the summation of all previous material, culminating in the final form of our app, incorporating the latest libraries and technologies.

* Front-end & Backend isolation with Create React App
* Front-end state management with reducers
* Popular React Libraries

### Module 6: Capstone Project

You are a software engineer, capable of exploring and learning new things. This is also a module where the practical aspects of Job Interview Preparation is done.

* With the assistance and advice of your SL and Rocket Staff, you will choose and learn new frameworks, libraries, technologies.
* Create something new to complete your transition into a Software Engineer.
* Interview Preparation: Resume, and Portfolio



## Projects

#### Project Requirements

Each module culminates in a project. The goal of each project is to demonstrate working knowledge of the the concepts learned in the module.

Project completion is a requirement to continue in bootcamp.

If any project is not completed up to the given project requirements, that student may no longer be eligible to continue in bootcamp.
