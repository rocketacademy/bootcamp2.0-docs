# 3.ICE.6: Inner Joins

## Instructions

1. Create a new branch `inner-join` in the [3.ICE.5: One to Many](../../../Module2/day8/inclass/3.ice.5-one-to-many.md) repo for today's exercise, and work in the `inner-join` branch.
2. Refactor the Cat Owners command line app from [3.ICE.5: One to Many](../../../Module2/day8/inclass/3.ice.5-one-to-many.md) to use [INNER JOIN](../../../Module2/day8/3.3-sql-language/3.3.4-inner-join.md) instead of [nested SQL queries](../../../Module2/day8/3.4-sql-applications/3.4.3-nested-sql-queries.md).
3. Complete [Comfortable](../../../Module2/day8/inclass/3.ice.5-one-to-many.md#comfortable) and [More Comfortable](../../../Module2/day8/inclass/3.ice.5-one-to-many.md#more-comfortable) sections in [3.ICE.5: One to Many](../../../Module2/day8/inclass/3.ice.5-one-to-many.md) if you have not already.
