# 10.1: HTML, CSS Referencing

## Introduction

We've completed the basics of how to code with JavaScript. Our hope is that you have some idea of how a program goes from conception to working code.

This course did not cover HTML and CSS in depth. HTML and CSS are **not** programming languages, and are used for formatting, layout, and styling the elements that are displayed by the browser. However, we may want to apply the programming logic we have learnt to manipulate and change what is displayed on the browser.&#x20;

In [10.2: Browser Application with DOM](12.1-browser-applications-with-dom.md), we will learn how to make our web applications more interactive by using JavaScript _logic_ to change the previously-static elements that are rendered by the browser. We can effectively write programs that change what the user sees. We can tell the browser _"_[_change the background color of this element when the submit button is clicked_](https://rocketacademy.github.io/basics-starter-code/dom/colours/index.html)_"_ or _"disable this button if the user runs out of money"_ or, if you are feeling nefarious, _"make this pop-up appear"_.

In order to do that, we must first be able to _reference_ HTML elements that have already been rendered and link them to JavaScript variables, so that we can manipulate them the same way we manipulated data previously.

## Referencing HTML elements

We'll review two basic ways to reference an HTML element: by their class or their ID.

When defining HTML elements in `index.html`, we can initially assign them an ID or a class. IDs are unique, and should not be applied to multiple elements (just like your ID number), but multiple HTML elements can share classes, and HTML elements can belong to multiple classes. Not all HTML elements need to have an ID or a class.

## Classes

More than one class can be applied to an element and more than one element can apply a class.

```markup
// This is the HTML File

<p class="card face-down">ace of spades</p>
<p class="card face-up">ace of clubs</p>
```

This CSS grabs these elements and applies these styles.

```css
// This is the CSS file

.card {
  background-color: pink;
}

.face-up {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.page-link {
  font: 'comic-sans';
}
```

## IDs

Only one ID can be applied to an element, though if you break this rule you won't get any errors, maybe just some unintended behaviours. An element can have both an ID and a class, or multiple classes..

```markup
<p id="player-card-one" class="card face-up">ace of spades</p>
```

This CSS grabs these elements and applies these styles.

```css
#player-card-one {
  border: 3px solid red;
}

#save-button {
  color: green;
}
```

## Basics Starter Code

Take a look at `index.html` from the basics-starter-code. Read through lines 62 to 74, and notice that some HTML elements have ids associated with them. Lines 81-99 reference some of these HTML elements, and defines the logic that has been associating the Submit button and input/output fields to the main function. We will now take a closer look at the syntax and concepts that make this work.
