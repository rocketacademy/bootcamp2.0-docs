# Rocket Q\&A

## Q\&A Formats

We have found the following formats helpful for students. Speakers can choose any of the following formats or propose another format.

1. 15-min speaker presentation on a project theyâ€™ve worked on, 45-min student-led Q\&A
   1. This helps students understand the work culture and project management at the speaker's companies.
2. 30-min speaker mock interviews 1 of our students, 30-min student-led Q\&A
   1. This helps students understand what the speaker's companies look for in software engineers.
3. 60-min student-led Q\&A
   1. If the speaker has less time to prepare, this option gives more time for students to ask about topics they are interested in.

## Sample Student Questions

The following are common questions that students ask.

1. Could you tell us about your journey as a software engineer?
2. What does a normal workday look like for you?
3. How do different companies compare in terms of technical and cultural environment?
4. What do you look for when hiring new software engineers?
5. What is the interview process for entry-level engineers at the companies you've worked at?
6. How do you and your company evaluate engineers' performance on the job?
7. How would you suggest aspiring software engineers best prepare themselves for the job?
8. What are some lessons you've learnt as an engineer that you would share with your younger self?
9. What are the main differences (if any) you've observed between university CS graduates and coding bootcamp graduates and how can both groups improve?
10. How should recent graduates go about their job search for software engineering jobs?
