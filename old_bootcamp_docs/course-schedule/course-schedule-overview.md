# Course Schedule Overview

## Introduction

The Coding Bootcamp schedule is organised by Course Days and Schedule Days. Course Days mark days of the course from 1 to 112. Schedule Days correspond to calendar days, e.g. Week 13 Day 4, where each Schedule Day has a designated Course Day except for public holidays during the course. Please see the Batch X Schedule page for your batch's schedule, where X is your batch number.

The Course Days page lists deliverables for each day of the course. Deliverables typically consist of videos, reading, and coding exercises. Each day's deliverables are due by the **start** of that day's class. We will complete exercises based on each day's deliverables in pairs during class.
