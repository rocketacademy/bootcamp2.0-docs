# D.0: DS&A Overview

## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms \(DS&A\) questions are a cornerstone of coding interviews. These will be similar to questions asked on popular interview prep platforms such as [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) or [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), or mentioned in well-known interview prep material such as [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/). DS&A topics are typically covered in university Computer Science curricula, and bootcamp grads are typically weak in these topics.

During the 2nd half of Coding Bootcamp we will learn the concepts behind and drill DS&A interview questions such that we can succeed in most such interview scenarios when we graduate.
